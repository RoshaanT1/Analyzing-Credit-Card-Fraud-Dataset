# Credit Card Fraud Detection EDA

## Overview
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers alike. Fraudulent activities lead to substantial financial losses and can severely impact customer trust. This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit card transaction dataset to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent behavior.


## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)


## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To analyze the dataset and gain insights into transaction patterns.
- To identify potential factors that distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones.


## EDA Questions
The following questions guided the exploratory data analysis:

1. How many rows and columns are in the dataset?
2. What are the column names and their data types?
3. Are there any missing or null values in the dataset?
4. How many transactions are fraudulent, and how many are legitimate?
5. What percentage of transactions are fraudulent?
6. What are the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values for numerical columns like Amount?
7. What is the maximum transaction amount in the dataset, and is it fraudulent?
8. Can we create a bar chart showing the count of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions?
9. What does the histogram of transaction amounts look like?
10. Can we use a heatmap to visualize correlations between features?


## Installation
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```


## Clone
